# Open Articles (OA)

---

### What is Open Articles?

It is the idea of creating a website that people can share their knowledge and
and help poeple out when they are confused or needed a help. The goal of this
hobbiest project is that I can rebuild the interface that I think is what
people would want and designing it in a way that people can browse the articles
in the website indefinetly.


### How is it different from other websites like Wikipedia, Qoura, Wikihow, etc.?

The diffrence is that, no javascript needed to function the websites (well maybe
some few exceptions like donations or something else), but being the main goal
of the website is to be lightweight and simple to use. Also **no tracking**
whatsoever and that's really the difference between other websites.



### Where do you get that idea from?

I get that idea from [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/). Why? because he
inpires me to create websites that are not bloat, functional, and easy to use.
Ans specifically, [based.cooking](https://based.cooking). I follow that same
idea that "You get what you need to see" and I hope that would help other web
developers to make their websites minimal and fnctional to use.


# Can I contribute to this projrct?

Well for now, I haven't plan the core basics of how my wesite looks and function
but you can suggest ideas if you want to.
