### What is Hall of text editors?

This is basically a website where you can read these articles and learn them
in such a way that it's not hard to look around or learning new things about
your text editor. Mainly any text editor can be mention on this website as long
as they are helpful to a lot of people.

### How is it different from other websites like Wikipedia, Qoura, Wikihow, etc.?

The diffrence is that, no javascript needed to function the websites (well maybe
some few exceptions like donations or something else), but being the main goal
of the website is to be lightweight and simple to use. Also **no tracking**
whatsoever and that's really the difference between other websites.



### Where do you get that idea from?

I get that idea from [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/). Why? because he
inpires me to create websites that are not bloat, functional, and easy to use.
And specifically, [based.cooking](https://based.cooking). I follow that same
idea that "You get what you need to see" and I hope that would help other web
developers to make their websites minimal and functional to use.


# Can I contribute to this project?

Well for now, I haven't plan the core basics of how my wesite looks and function
but you can suggest ideas if you want to.
